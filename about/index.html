<p>Being Humble means respect for another developer&#8217;s work, from noobs to neckbeards. The Panda believes even the newest developers have something to teach him. <strong>The Panda&#8217;s journey</strong> is that of discovery, being humble allows him to keep an <strong>open mind</strong> on every new encounter.</p>

<p>Discipline leads to the best possible solutions, without compromise. When you cut one corner early on, you end up cutting even more throughout a project. <strong>The Panda</strong> believes that engineering compromises and sloppy work are not equivelant.</p>

<p>Passion is what motivates the Panda to do keep going even when solutions are months away. <strong>Passion drives the Panda to create products and solutions with the highest quality</strong>. Passion drives the Panda to share what he&#8217;s learned along his travels.</p>
